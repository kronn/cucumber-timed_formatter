= Timed Progress Formatter

In order to get a quick overview over the scenarios and running times
As a developer and CI-user
I want to have a timed cucumber formatter

== Installation/Usage

If you're using Rails, simply drop it in your features/support directory.

Then, you can say:

cucumber features/* -f Cucumber::Formatter::Timed

Not using Rails? You just need to ensure that the file is somewhere it can be
included, and call it like:

cucumber features/* --require path/to/timed.rb -f Cucumber::Formatter::Timed
