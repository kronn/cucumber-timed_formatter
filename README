= Timed Progress Formatter

In order to get a quick overview over the scenarios and running times
As a developer and CI-user
I want to have a timed cucumber formatter

== Installation/Usage

If you're using Rails, simply drop it in your features/support directory.

Then, you can say:

cucumber features/* -f Cucumber::Formatter::Timed

Not using Rails? You just need to ensure that the file is somewhere it can be
included, and call it like:

cucumber features/* --require path/to/timed.rb -f Cucumber::Formatter::Timed

== Version Note

The current version 1.0 should be working with cucumber 2.x. If not, please
open an issue or pull request.

cucumber 1.x was supported in version 0.2 of this gem.
